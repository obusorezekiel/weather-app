# Weather App.

This is my first Nodejs practice project. I built a weather app that gets forecast data from Dark Sky API and location data from GEOCODE and interacts together to give you accurate weather information about your location around the world. 

 You can
 - Get a predictive analysis of the weather in your locale

 - View existing weather information about any city you are interested in, especially before flights
